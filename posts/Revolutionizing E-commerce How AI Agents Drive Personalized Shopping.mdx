Visual search allows shoppers  to  search for products by simply uploading an  image, while AR technology enables them to virtually try on products, interact with items in their own environment, and visualize how products would look in their homes. These immersive experiences not only enhance customer  satisfaction but also reduce  uncertainty and returns,  leading to increased sales and a more positive overall  shopping experience.
